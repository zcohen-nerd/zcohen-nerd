# Hi, I'm Zachary Cohen  

**Senior Electromechanical Engineer focused on embedded systems, custom electronics, and integrated hardware platforms.**

I design and build complete electromechanical systems—from architecture and schematics to PCB layout, firmware bring-up, mechanical integration, and validation.

My work lives at the intersection of electronics, mechanics, and software, with a focus on robustness, clarity, and real-world deployment. Many of my projects are open-source and designed to make complex engineering systems easier to understand and build.

## Selected Projects  

### [SENTRY Autonomous Turret](https://github.com/zcohenld/SENTRY)  
Embedded mechatronics platform designed to teach system integration, motor control, sensing, and real-time control.  
Includes custom PCBs, embedded firmware, and full electromechanical integration.

### [Fusion System Blocks](https://github.com/zcohen-nerd/Fusion_System_Blocks)  
Fusion add-in enabling native block diagramming and system-level architecture directly inside CAD.  
Bridges the gap between system design and implementation.

### Swarm Robotics Testbed  
Distributed fleet of autonomous marine vessels using embedded control systems, custom electronics, and modular system architecture for autonomy research and education.

### Custom Embedded and Hardware Platforms  
Development boards, drone control systems, lab instrumentation, and engineering tools designed for robustness, clarity, and real-world use.
