Electronics Technician with Specialization in Additive Manufacturing | US Naval Academy || Pursuing MEng in Additive Manufacturing | Penn State World Campus

Transitioning from a background in high school engineering education to a role as electronics technician in the Weapons, Robotics, and Controls Engineering Department at the United States Naval Academy, I have honed a unique blend of practical experience and academic skills in the field of engineering. Currently I'm supporting classes and assisting students while contributing to research projects for the Navy. My expertise lies in engineering design, additive manufacturing, and electronics, underpinned by a solid foundation in general engineering principles.

Parallel to my professional work, I am advancing my academic credentials by pursuing a Master's in Engineering in Additive Manufacturing and Design from Penn State World Campus. My academic focus is deeply rooted in generative design and additive manufacturing with polymers, areas that I am not only passionate about but also see as the future of our industry.

A distinctive strength of mine is my proficiency in Autodesk Fusion and other CAD programs. I primarily utilize Fusion for intricate engineering and generative design tasks. My ability to juggle multiple projects simultaneously while addressing complex engineering challenges has been a key factor in my professional growth.

I am driven by a commitment to continuous learning and improvement, aiming to further both my professional capabilities and personal growth. As I navigate through the evolving landscape of engineering and technology, my goal remains to contribute meaningfully to the field and to remain at the forefront of innovation in additive manufacturing and design.
